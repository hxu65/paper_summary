# Deep Learning Inference in Facebook Data Centers: Characterization, Performance Optimizations and Hardware Implications
## Motivation 
a great challenge has been the fast pace of changes in DL applications: the previously relevant AlexNet [40] is no longer representative of the computation characteristics of todayâ€™s computer vision (CV) systems. The rate of change in DL models is so fast that hardware optimized for old models can easily become inefficient for new models.
