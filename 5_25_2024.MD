# Dynamic Trees for Learning and Design

Dynamic Regression Trees: These trees adapt over time with new data, allowing for efficient on-line posterior filtering of tree states using particle learning algorithms. This results in better performance at a lower cost compared to traditional methods. <br>
here are three possible moves that can be applied to the tree's structure at each time step when new data is observed:<br>
**Stay**: The tree structure remains unchanged,  If the tree stays the same, the new data point is simply incorporated without changing the tree structure. <br>
**Prune**: The tree is pruned by removing a node and its subtree. In pruning, a node and its sibling (if it exists) are removed, making their parent a new leaf node.  <br>
**Grow**: The tree grows by adding a new partition based on a new split: Growing involves choosing a split dimension and split point to create two new leaf nodes from the existing node containing  <br>


Mechanism of Evolution:
Localized Changes: The tree evolution is localized to the region of the newly observed data point. <br>
This means that only the partition containing and its immediate neighborhood are considered for changes. <br>
Probabilities of Moves: Each of the possible moves (stay, prune, grow) is a priori equally probable, though this can be adjusted based on specific requirements. <br>
